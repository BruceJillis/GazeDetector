Enderman Gaze Detector
======================

A small but non-trivial minecraft mod that replaces vanilla mob-heads and adds an enderman head that emits redstone when viewed from a (configurable) distance.

Instructions
============

Getting this running is pretty simple: get MCP + eclipse up and running, download this repository and extract it in the src/ folder and press play.
