Enderman Gaze Detector
======================

A small but non-trivial minecraft mod that replaces vanilla mob-heads with equivalents and adds an enderman head that emits a redstone signal when viewed from a (configurable) distance. This mod uses tile entities, client server communication, hooks into a power system and needs some custom rendering and bases itself heavily on decompiled minecraft code and its assets.
